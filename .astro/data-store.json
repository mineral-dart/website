This project combines the power of Astro with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide a smooth development experience.\n\n## Why Explainer?\n\nDocumentation is often overlooked, but it's essential for the adoption and effective use of your project.\nExplainer fills an important gap in the technical documentation ecosystem. While Vue has robust solutions like Vitepress, the React ecosystem suffers from a lack of alternatives that don't depend on Next.js. Most documentation frameworks for React are closely tied to Next.js, which can be limiting for many projects.\n\nThis is where Astro, and by extension Explainer, particularly shines. Astro offers remarkable flexibility by allowing you to integrate any technological component related to your business. You can easily incorporate React, Vue, Svelte components, or even standard web elements according to your specific needs.\n\nThis agnostic approach allows you to create documentation that perfectly aligns with your existing technology stack, without forcing you to adopt a particular ecosystem. Whether you work with React, Vue, or other frameworks, Explainer adapts to your needs rather than the other way around.","src/content/blog/welcome.mdx","f5b3166b4e8226c4",true,"guide",["Map",25,26,35,36,44,45,53,54,63,64,72,73],"commands",{"id":25,"data":27,"body":32,"filePath":33,"digest":34,"deferredRender":22},{"title":28,"description":29,"permalink":25,"order":30,"icon":31},"Commands","Lorem

It's simple yet meets the need for rapid implementation.\n\nOne of the limitations arises when your application grows more or less drastically: you'll end up with a multitude of files at the same level, which can lead to poor understanding of your application.\n\n---\n\n## N-tier structure\n\nWhen you're developing increasingly complex applications, you generally lose readability and maintainability\nand maintainability if you don't focus on a stable, future-proof software architecture.\n\n> [!note]\n> We recommend the following structure.\n\nOne approach we recommend is the module-based architecture.\nThis involves dividing your application into several business modules that are independent of each other.\n\n```\n├── assets\n│  ├── image1.png\n│  └── image2.png\n│\n├── bin\n│  └── main.dart\n│\n├── lib\n│  ├── commons\n│  │  ├── helper.dart\n│  │  └── api.dart\n│  │\n│  ├── first_module\n│  │  ├── events\n│  │  ├── commands\n│  │  └── provider.dart\n│  │\n│  └── second_module\n│     ├── events\n│     ├── commands\n│     └── provider.dart\n│\n├── pubspec.yaml\n└── .env\n```\n\nThis architecture has several notable advantages: it allows you to:\n- divide your application code into modules, each representing a business fragment\n- simplifies the integration of your code across multiple projects thanks to [`providers`](/docs/api/providers)\n\nIn this architecture, we use [`providers`](/docs/api/providers) allowing us to \"move\" the entry point of our module in order to facilitate the segmentation of our code.\n\nTo simplify the management of your modules, we recommend that you create a `provider.dart` file within each which will\nserve as the entry point for each module.\n\n:::code-group labels=[main.dart, module/provider.dart]\n```dart\nfinal client = Client()\n  .registerProvider(Provider.new) // [!code ++]\n  .build();\n```\n\n```dart\nfinal class Provider extends Provider {\n  final MineralClientContract _client;\n\n  Provider(this._client) {\n    _client.register(MyEvent.new); // [!code ++]\n    _client.registerCommand(MyCommand.new); // [!code ++]\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Layered architecture\n\nWhen we talk about modular architecture, we quickly come to hexagonal architecture.\nThis architecture allows you to decouple the different parts of your application according to their core business and\nresponsibility within it.\n\n> [!note]\n> We recommend the following structure.\n\n```\n├── bin\n│  └── main.dart\n│\n├── lib\n│  ├── ui\n│  │  ├── events\n│  │  │  ├── ready_event.dart\n│  │  │  └── message_create_event.dart\n│  │  │\n│  │  └── commands\n│  │     └── foo_command.dart\n│  │\n│  ├── services\n│  │  └── foo_service.dart\n│  │\n│  ├── data\n│  │  ├── models\n│  │  └── repositories\n│  │\n│  └── provider.dart\n│\n├── pubspec.yaml\n└── .env\n```\n\nThe above structure is an example that we recommend to help you adopt a modular, scalable and maintainable architecture by decoupling the different parts of your application as much as possible.\nHowever, it will not always suit your business needs and will need to be adapted accordingly.\n\n| Directory | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `ui` | Contains the various parts of your application which are related to your business, including `events` and `commands`. |\n| `services` | Contains the services which allow you to manipulate the data in your application; they will generally be used from the `ui`. |\n| `data` | Contains the DTOs and repositories that allow you to manipulate the data in your application. An example of use is the use of a remote REST service to which you need to make HTTP calls. |\n| `provider` | The entry point of your module who's call under the `main` file. |\n\n---\n\n## Hexagonal architecture\n\nWhen we talk about modular architecture, we quickly come to hexagonal architecture.\nThis architecture allows you to decouple the different parts of your application according to their core business and\nresponsibility within it.\n\n> [!note]\n> We recommend the following structure.\n\n```\n├── bin\n│  └── main.dart\n│\n├── lib\n│  └── application\n│  │  └── tickets\n│  │     ├── commands\n│  │     ├── events\n│  │     └── ticket_provider.dart\n│  │\n│  ├── domain\n│  │  └── tickets\n│  │     ├── entities\n│  │     ├── repositories\n│  │     ├── dtos\n│  │     └── contracts\n│  │\n│  └── infrastructure\n│     └── tickets\n│        ├── repositories\n│        └── dtos\n│   \n├── pubspec.yaml\n└── .env\n```\n\nThis architecture has several notable advantages: it allows you to:\n- divide your application code into modules, each representing a business fragment\n- simplifies the integration of your code across multiple projects thanks to [`providers`](/docs/api/providers)\n- isolate the business logic of your application from the infrastructure layer\n\nThe `application` directory contains all of our business context divided into modules, allowing better readability and maintainability of our code.\n\n| Directory | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `bin` | Contains the entry point of your application. |\n| `application` | Contains the various parts of your application which are related to your business, including `events`, `commands`, `states` or any mineral component, it can be split into modules. |\n| `domain` | Contains the entities, DTOs, repositories, contracts that allow you to manipulate the data in your application. He contains the business logic of your application and must not depend on anything other than itself. |\n| `infrastructure` | Contains implementations that must interact with external services such as APIs, BDDs and queues. Each implementation must implement a contract defined in the domain. |\n\n> [!note]\n> You can find a sample implementation of this architecture [here](https://github.com/LeadcodeDev/mineral_beta_bot_demo).","src/content/docs/guide/structure.mdx","b64b48dd7bb0d01e","installation",{"id":72,"data":74,"body":78,"filePath":79,"digest":80,"deferredRender":22},{"title":75,"description":29,"permalink":72,"order":76,"icon":77},"Installation",1,"lucide:play","# Installation\n\nBefore embarking on this crazy discord adventure, you will need to follow the steps outlined below to set up a clean and healthy project.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\nPlease make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine before you start.\n\n### Dart lang\nThe Mineral framework has been developed entirely in the Dart programming language, so you will need to install it in your development environment first.

Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| `project_name` | The name of the project to create. |\n| `token` | When the command is run, you will be asked to enter your application's token in order

:\n- `Slim` : A minimalist project with a minimal basic structure.\n- `Basic` : A preset based on an architecture that groups components by type.\n- `Hexagonal` : A preset based on an architecture that groups components by domain.\n\n> [!important]\n> See the [dedicated section](/docs/guide/structure) for more information on the structure of a project.\n\n---\n\n### Make event\n\nThe

be asked to define it later.\n\nThe command will offer you a choice of two types of command :\n- Declaration\n- Definition\n\nFor each of the cases presented, you will be asked to complete your order by means of a question and answer game.\n\nYou can find more information about orders in the [dedicated section](/docs/fundamentals/commands).\n\n---\n\n### Make provider\n\nThe `make:provider` command is used to create a new provider.\n\n:::code-group auto\n```bash\nmineral make:provider [name]\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> If you do not provide the name of your file, you will be asked to define it later.\n\nSee the [dedicated section](/docs/fundamentals/providers) for more information on providers.\n\n---\n\n### Make state\n\nThe `make:state` command is used to create a new state.\n\n:::code-group auto\n```bash\nmineral make:state [name]\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> If you do not provide the name of your file, you will be asked to define it later.\n\nSee the [dedicated section](/docs/fundamentals/global-states) for more information on shared states.\n\n## Make your own commands\n\nYou can also create your own commands to simplify or automate certain processes.\n\nThe procedure explained below is valid when you want to create commands for your project but also as part of packages\nregistered on the `dart pub` registry.\n\n> [!note]\n> Some packages may have their own commands.\n> Simply installing the package will automatically inject the commands into the CLI __without any additional action__.\n\nTo collect choices from the user of your order, we recommend that you use\nthe [`commander_ui`](https://github.com/LeadcodeDev/commander) library, which will enable you to create interactive\ninterfaces within CLi and the [`mansion`](https://pub.dev/packages/mansion) package to make colored output.\n\n---\n\n### Structure\n\nWe recommend that you structure your commands according to the structure recommended in the official documentation.\n\nWe will use a `bin` folder for this purpose, but you are free to choose the location.\n\n```\n├── bin\n│  └── main.dart\n│\n// [!code ++:3]\n├── cli\n│  ├── my_command.dart\n│  └── my_command2.dart\n│\n├── pubspec.yaml\n└── .env\n```\n\n---\n\n### Declaration\n\nDeclaring a command is an important step, as it indicates its existence within the CLI.\n\nFollowing the example of Flutter, add a new `mineral` key to the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project.\nwhich will contain a list of commands.\n\n:::code-group labels=[pubspec.yaml]\n```yaml\nname: my_application\ndescription: A simple mineral application\n\n# [!code ++:5]\nmineral:\n  commands:\n    - name: my_command\n      description: My first command\n      entrypoint: cli/my_command.dart\n\nenvironment:\ndependencies:\ndev_dependencies:\n```\n:::\n\nThe use of a `yaml` file is mandatory because the CLI invokes the targeted command through the spawn of a new `Process`.\n\n---\n\n### Entrypoint\n\nThe input file for your command is the file that will be invoked by the CLI.\nIt is defined when mapping your commands in the `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n:::code-group labels=[pubspec.yaml]\n```yaml\nmineral:\n  commands:\n    - name: my_command\n      description: My first command\n      # [!code highlight]\n      entrypoint: cli/my_command.dart\n```\n:::\n\nThe sine qua non condition for this invocation to work properly is the presence of a hand' function in the file containing your command.\n\nWe can think of each command as a program in its own right which can itself instantiate various services used within\nyour Mineral application in the same way as when you start it.\n\n> [!note]\n> A command has no `Mineral` reference instance, so if you want to use components from the framework, you'll have to instantiate them yourself.\n\nFor example, you can use Mineral's environment service to retrieve environment variables environment variables within\nyour main application.\n\n:::code-group labels=[cli/my_command.dart, .env]\n```dart\nimport 'package:mineral/api.dart';\nimport 'package:mineral/services.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  final token = env.get(AppEnv.token);\n  print('Your token is $token');\n}\n```\n```dotenv\nDART_ENV=development\nTOKEN=your_token\nDISCORD_REST_API_VERSION=10\nDISCORD_WS_VERSION=10\nINTENT=3276799\nLOG_LEVEL=TRACE\n```\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Help displaying\n\n> [!note]\n> You can sort your orders by name.\n\nIf your command is called `migration:run` or `migration:rollback`, it will be filed in the dedicated migration section.\n\n```\n...\nMIGRATION

Environment variables\n\nEnvironment variables serve the purpose of storing secrets like the database password, the app secret, or an API key outside of your application codebase.\n\nIn addition, environment variables can be used to obtain different configurations depending on the environment, such as the use of a secret to use an API or database identifiers.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\nNormally, environment variables are accessible via Dart's `Platform` class, but this is said to be immutable, so we can't add data relating to our application to it.\n\nSo we're providing an `Environment` class to access the various environment variables in your application.\n\n> [!important]\n> Environment variable management is deported to an agnostic package [`env_guard`](https://pub.dev/packages/env_guard) created for this purpose and which can be used in any Dart or Flutter project.\n\n\nThe environment management is done from the `Env` class which is made available from the `env_guard` package.\n\n:::code-group labels=[env.dart]\n```dart\nabstract interface class Env {\n  T get\u003CT>(String key, {T? defaultValue});\n\n  Map\u003CString, dynamic>

Placeholders\n\nPlaceholders can be used to replace values in configuration files and are useful for to inject values from external\nsources into your code.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen a developer designs an application for distribution, they generally need to be able to customise its configurations, \nso we generally end up with configuration files written in `yaml` or `json`.\n\nThis configuration imposes two major constraints:\n- The data structure is important and is required for the application to function properly\n- The values are static and cannot be changed without modifying the configuration file.\n\nThis second point is certainly the most important, as it is necessary to allow the application to function in a totally \ntransparent way depending on the environment in which it is evolving.\n\nWe can therefore conclude that it is necessary to be able to inject values into the configuration files.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\nDefine a `config.yaml` configuration file containing a `sayHello` key with the value `Hello {username} {emoji}`.\n\n:::code-group labels=[config.yaml]\n```yaml\nsayHello: Hello {username} {emoji}\n```\n:::\n\n### Static\n\n:::code-group labels=[main.dart]\n```dart\nvoid main() async {\n  final config = await File('config.yaml').readAsYaml();\n  // [!code ++:3]\n  final placeholder = Placeholder(values: {\n    'emoji': '👋',\n  });\n  \n  final value = placeholder.apply(config['sayHello']); // [!code ++]\n  print(value); // Hello {username} 👋\n}\n```\n:::\n\nWe then instantiated a `Placeholder` object containing a set of values to inject into our configuration file.\nFinally, we applied our placeholder to our configuration value.\n\nWe can see that the `emoji` slot has been replaced by 👋 but not the `username` key.

and then used in the rest of the application via a\nsingle instance.\napplication using a single instance.\n\nIt improves the modularity and reusability of the code, as well as its testability.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nInversion of Control (`IoC`) is a design principle used in software development to increase the modularity and flexibility\nof code. It involves delegating the control of certain aspects of a program, such as the creation and management of\nobjects, to a container or framework.\n\nThis approach allows developers to focus on the business logic of their application while the IoC container handles the\ninstantiation and lifecycle of dependencies.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Decoupling :** IoC reduces the tight coupling between components, making the system more adaptable to changes. Ease of Maintenance: With a clear separation of concerns, maintaining and updating the code becomes more straightforward.\n- **Testability :** Dependencies can be injected, making it easier to write unit tests and achieve higher test coverage.\n- **Flexibility :** It provides the flexibility to change implementations without modifying the dependent code, facilitating easier updates and maintenance.\n\n## How it works\n\nIn your applications, it is common to want to share services between several components such as\nrepositories, services, configurations, etc.\n\nIoC simplifies the task by allowing you to define these services in a central container and use them in the rest of the application via a single instance.\nthe rest of the application via a single instance.\n\n> [!note]\n> Follow [this link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) to learn more about `Singleton` pattern.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nWithin the Mineral framework, we have decided not to use code generation (judging a lack of\ncontrol), which means writing additional code in order to make full use of IoC.\n\nBasically, an IoC involving service injection consists of two stages.\n\n1. Creation of a service in the form of a class\n2. Call of the service by a consumer. If the service exists, it is injected, otherwise it is instantiated and then injected.\n\n## Mineral usage\n\nIn the Dart language, it is impossible to locate the services called without using reflection,\nbut using it means that you can no longer compile the application to `jit`, `aot`, `exe`... because this reflection only\nonly works within the Dart VM.\n\nAs it is, we have to inject our services ourselves.\n\n> [!note]\n> With the announcement and development of `macros` in Dart, it is possible that we will be able to automate this task of\n> instantiation task.\n\n### Create a service\n\n:::code-group labels=[service.dart]\n```dart\nfinal class MyClass {\n  void sayHello() => print('Hello World');\n}\n```\n:::\n\n### Register and resolve the service\n\nThere are two ways of registering our service with the IoC :\n\n1. bind: registers a service without returning it.\n2. make: registers a service and returns it.\n\n> [!warning]\n> It is not possible to retrieve a service not previously instantiated in the IoC.\n\n:::code-group labels=[binding, making]\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  ioc.bind(MyClass.new);\n\n  final service = ioc.resolve\u003CMyClass>();\n  service.sayHello();\n}\n```\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  final service = ioc.make(MyClass.new);\n  service.sayHello();\n}\n```\n:::\n\nIn order to abstract a service, it is also possible to give an `interface` instead of a direct implementation.\n\n:::code-group labels=[main.dart,service.dart, contract]\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n   // [!code --:2]\n  ioc.bind(MyClass.new);\n  final service = ioc.resolve\u003CMyClass>();\n\n // [!code ++:2]\n  ioc.bind\u003CMyClassContract>(MyClass.new);\n  final service = ioc.resolve\u003CMyClassContract>();\n\n  service.sayHello();\n}\n```\n```dart\nfinal class MyClass implements MyClassContract {\n  void sayHello() => print('Hello World');\n}\n```\n```dart\nabstract interface class MyClassContract {\n  void sayHello();\n}\n```\n:::","src/content/docs/api/container.mdx","6c5bb667dd109163","hmr",{"id":156,"data":158,"body":163,"filePath":164,"digest":165,"deferredRender":22},{"title":159,"description":160,"permalink":156,"order":161,"icon":162},"Hot Module Replacement","Hot Module Replacement is a feature that allows you to replace a module without reloading the page.",11,"lucide:zap","# Hot Module Reloading\n\nWithin the Mineral ecosystem, HMR (Hot Module Reloading) is a feature that automatically reloads your business code\nwithout having to restart your project or recreate a connection to Discord's Websocket API.\n\n> [!warning]\n> This feature is experimental and may not work as expected.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis feature is particularly useful when you are developing your application and want to see the changes you make without having to restart your project.\n\nIt is important to note that the HMR only reloads the contents of your project's `lib` folder and not the external dependencies.\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you start the application from the `dart run` command, it will perform three distinct actions :\n1. Initialise the connection with Discord's Websocket\n2. Listen for incoming events\n3. Start the business part of your application\n\nIt is important to note that the business part of your application is run within an `Isolate` child of the main application.\n\nThis isolate is responsible for all the business actions in your application, such as managing commands, events and interactions.\n\nWhen you create, update or save a file in the `lib` folder, the application will automatically detect the changes using the `Watcher` component.\n\nIn one of these three cases, this watcher will destroy this child `Isolate` and create a new one, which will have the effect of reloading your entire business application.\n\n> [!note]\n> The child Isolate does not create any new instances of the HMR and the Websocket client\n\nCommunications from your application to Discord's Websocket API are passed from the business Isolate to the main Isolate, and then to the Websocket API.\n\n\n## Persistence through reloading\n\nAt this stage, we have the expected behaviour of reloading the entire business application when a file is saved.\n\nThe problem we now face is the loss of the application's state each time it is reloaded.\nThis state is as much the responsibility of the memory, if the application uses it as a cache, as of the synchronisation of the local state (application) with the remote state (Discord) of our data.\n\nThere are a multitude of solutions to this problem, but the simplest and most effective is to store the alteration to the state of our data in the application's main process.\n\nTo do this, we need to intercept packets entering the application using Discord's Websocket, and then store them in memory.\nEach time the application is reloaded, this data can be re-injected into the business application in order to re-synchronise it by replaying past events.\n\n## Using the HMR\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, add the retrieval of the Isolate port to the `main` function parameters, then transfer them to your `ClientBuilder` instance using the `setHmrDevPort` method.\n\n:::code-group labels=[main.dart]\n```dart\nFuture\u003Cvoid> main() async { // [!code --]\nFuture\u003Cvoid> main(_, port) async { // [!code ++]\n  final client = ClientBuilder()\n      .setCache((e) => MemoryProvider())\n      .setHmrDevPort(port) // [!code ++]\n      .build();\n  \n  await client.init();\n}\n```\n:::","src/content/docs/api/hmr.mdx","6ac4f6a36a345c63","datastore",{"id":166,"data":168,"body":111,"filePath":173,"digest":174,"deferredRender":22},{"title":169,"description":170,"permalink":166,"order":171,"icon":172},"Datastore","Data store is a concept that allows you to store the data for the application.",12,"lucide:satellite-dish","src/content/docs/api/datastore.mdx","fdbc6815fdc469d0","concepts",["Map",177,178,186,187],"data-caching",{"id":177,"data":179,"body":183,"filePath":184,"digest":185,"deferredRender":22},{"title":180,"description":181,"permalink":177,"order":67,"icon":182},"Data caching","Data caching is a mechanism that caches the data for the application.","lucide:database","# Data Caching\n\nWhen developing a Discord application, it is customary to save objects in memory. This has the advantage of making them instantly accessible, but also of preserving their integrity.\n\n---\n\n## Problem\nOn the scale of a small application, this does not have any harmful effects, but as your application evolves and has to accommodate more and more members, the memory is used more and more until it reaches a threshold that we call \"no return\", which in some cases can more or less impact the entire infrastructure on which your application is hosted.\n\n## Concrete example\n\nLet's imagine the hypothetical case of an application that has to support more than 5,000 Discord servers, each with more than 300,000 members.\n\n> [!note]\n> The values taken as examples, such as the number of Discord servers and the number of members on each, are hypothetical and fictitious.\n\nThis mass of data represents a considerable load on the memory of the machine hosting your application.\n\nTraditionally it is chosen to remove the existing Discord interaction library in its preferred language in order to abstract itself from its data management method, so the application reverts to a state of API call to the HTTP API and traditional listening on the Discord websocket in order to no longer depend on your application's memory.\n\n## Caching system\nThanks to Mineral's caching system, the management of this memory is deported to a caching provider that allows you to move this memory when it is needed, so you can move it to another machine.\n\nThanks to the Dart language, we can compile our applications in order to drastically reduce our power consumption. To this end, and in order to reduce this consumption as much as possible, which in some cases remains high, we are providing a caching service that can be used to deport the location of objects currently in memory to a remote service.\n\n> [!warning]\n> Please note that depending on your chosen caching solution, certain costs may apply.\n> This is particularly visible on cloud solutions that calculate your rates based on consumption.\n\nThe Mineral framework offers official support for several caching providers.\n\n---\n\n### Memory Provider\nThis is the simplest caching solution, as it simply stores the data in memory.\n\nTo use it, you need to add the `mineral_cache` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and then declare its use in your Mineral client builder.\n\n:::code-group labels=[main.dart, pubspec.yaml]\n```dart\nfinal client = ClientBuilder()\n  .setCache(MemoryProvider.new) // [!code ++]\n  .build();\n```\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  mineral_cache: ^0.0.1 # [!code ++]\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> No environment variable is required to use this provider.\n\n---\n\n### Redis Provider\nBased on a powerful caching solution, the Redis provider allows you to deport your growing memory to an external solution.\n\nTo use it, you need to add the `mineral_cache` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and then declare its use in your Mineral client builder.\n\n:::code-group labels=[main.dart, pubspec.yaml]\n```dart\nFuture\u003Cvoid> main(_, port) async {\n  final client = ClientBuilder()\n    .setHmrDevPort(port)\n    .setCache((_) => RedisProvider(\n      host: 'localhost',\n      port: 6379,\n      password: 'password',\n    ))\n    .build();\n}\n```\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  mineral_cache: ^0.0.1 # [!code ++]\n```\n:::\n\nTo simplify the injection of environment variables, the provider provides an `factory` to used environment variables as default values.\n\n```dart\nFuture\u003Cvoid> main(_, port) async {\n  final client = ClientBuilder()\n    .setHmrDevPort(port)\n    // [!code --:5]\n    .setCache((_) => RedisProvider(\n      host: 'localhost',\n      port: 6379,\n      password: 'password',\n    ))\n    .setCache(RedisProvider.fromEnvironment) // [!code ++]\n    .build();\n}\n```\n\n> [!note]\n> It is important to note that using the `factory` automatically validates the variables required in your environment.\n\nThe minimum environment variables are :\n\n:::code-group labels=[.env, schema.dart]\n```dotenv\nREDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1\nREDIS_PORT=6380\nREDIS_PASSWORD=redis\n```\n```dart\nfinal class RedisEnv implements DefineEnvironment {\n  static final String redisHost = 'REDIS_HOST';\n  static final String redisPort = 'REDIS_PORT';\n  static final String redisPassword = 'REDIS_PASSWORD';\n\n  @override\n  final Map\u003CString, EnvSchema> schema = {\n    redisHost: env.string(),\n    redisPort: env.number(),\n    redisPassword: env.string(),\n  };\n}\n```\n:::\n\n## Extending the Cache Provider\nIf you want to use a caching solution that is not officially supported, you can extend Mineral's caching system by creating your own provider.\n\nTo do this, you need to create a class that extends the `CacheProvider` class and implement the methods that are required.\n\n:::code-group labels=[my_provider.dart, contract.dart]\n```dart\nfinal class MyProvider implements CacheProviderContract {\n  @override\n  String get name => 'my_provider';\n\n  @override\n  late final LoggerContract logger;\n  \n  // Implement all required methods and properties\n  // provided by the CacheProviderContract.\n}\n```\n\n```dart\nabstract interface class CacheProviderContract {\n  String get name;\n\n  abstract LoggerContract logger;\n\n  FutureOr\u003Cvoid> init();\n\n  Future\u003Cint> length();\n  Future\u003CList\u003CT>> getAll\u003CT extends dynamic>();\n  Future\u003CString?> get(String?
