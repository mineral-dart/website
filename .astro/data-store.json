It's built with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.",[17],"leadcode_dev","2024-01-01:23:00:00","# Welcome to Explainer\n\nExplainer is a documentation boilerplate designed to help you create beautiful, responsive, and accessible web documentation using [Astro](https://astro.build). This project combines the power of Astro with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide a smooth development experience.\n\n## Why Explainer?\n\nDocumentation is often overlooked, but it's essential for the adoption and effective use of your project.\nExplainer fills an important gap in the technical documentation ecosystem. While Vue has robust solutions like Vitepress, the React ecosystem suffers from a lack of alternatives that don't depend on Next.js. Most documentation frameworks for React are closely tied to Next.js, which can be limiting for many projects.\n\nThis is where Astro, and by extension Explainer, particularly shines. Astro offers remarkable flexibility by allowing you to integrate any technological component related to your business. You can easily incorporate React, Vue, Svelte components, or even standard web elements according to your specific needs.\n\nThis agnostic approach allows you to create documentation that perfectly aligns with your existing technology stack, without forcing you to adopt a particular ecosystem. Whether you work with React, Vue, or other frameworks, Explainer adapts to your needs rather than the other way around.","src/content/blog/welcome.mdx","f5b3166b4e8226c4",true,"guide",["Map",25,26,35,36,44,45,53,54,62,63,71,72],"commands",{"id":25,"data":27,"body":32,"filePath":33,"digest":34,"deferredRender":22},{"title":28,"description":29,"permalink":25,"order":30,"icon":31},"Commands","Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",5,"lucide:square-slash","# Events","src/content/docs/guide/commands.mdx","cd48d09fc2241dd4","environment-variables",{"id":35,"data":37,"body":41,"filePath":42,"digest":43,"deferredRender":22},{"title":38,"description":29,"permalink":35,"order":39,"icon":40},"Environment variables",3,"lucide:key-round","# Environment variables","src/content/docs/guide/environment-variables.mdx","923e3a55a15e7b05","deployment",{"id":44,"data":46,"body":50,"filePath":51,"digest":52,"deferredRender":22},{"title":47,"description":29,"permalink":44,"order":48,"icon":49},"Deployment",6,"lucide:rocket","# Deployment","src/content/docs/guide/deployment.mdx","f3aa799d54ee08d9","event",{"id":53,"data":55,"body":32,"filePath":60,"digest":61,"deferredRender":22},{"title":56,"description":29,"permalink":57,"order":58,"icon":59},"Events","events",4,"lucide:bell","src/content/docs/guide/event.mdx","a10422a19267033e","structure",{"id":62,"data":64,"body":68,"filePath":69,"digest":70,"deferredRender":22},{"title":65,"description":29,"permalink":62,"order":66,"icon":67},"Structure",2,"lucide:folder-tree","# Structure","src/content/docs/guide/structure.mdx","2aa298fb8912a212","installation",{"id":71,"data":73,"body":77,"filePath":78,"digest":79,"deferredRender":22},{"title":74,"description":29,"permalink":71,"order":75,"icon":76},"Installation",1,"lucide:play","# Installation\n\nBefore embarking on this crazy discord adventure, you will need to follow the steps outlined below to set up a clean and healthy project.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\nPlease make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine before you start.\n\n## Dart lang\nThe Mineral framework has been developed entirely in the Dart programming language, so you will need to install it in your development environment first. In order to best install it, please refer to the [official documentation](https://dart.dev/get-dart).\n\n> [!note]\n> The version of the Dart language sdk must be at least `^3.5.2`.\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n### From the CLI\n\nYou can use the Mineral CLI to create a new project.\n\nFollow the steps below to install the CLI.\n\n:::code-group auto\n```bash\ndart pub global activate mineral_cli [version]\n\ncd path/to/your/projects\nmineral create my_project\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> More details about the CLI can be found in the [`command line`](/docs/api/cli) section.\n\n---\n\n### From scratch\n\nUse the following command to start a new blank Dart project.\n```bash\ndart create my_project\n```\n\nAfter creating the project, you will need to add the Mineral framework to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n:::code-group labels=[pubspec.yaml]\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  mineral: ^4.0.0-dev.10\n  mineral_cache: ^1.0.0-dev.3\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> Please verify the lasted version of the [`core`](https://pub.dev/packages/mineral) and [`cache`](https://pub.dev/packages/mineral_cache) packages directly on registry.\n\nThen run the following command to install the dependencies.\n\n:::code-group auto\n```bash\ndart pub get\n```\n:::\n\nAssurez-vous d'avoir la structure minimale suivante dans votre projet.\n\n```\n├── bin\n│  └── main.dart\n│\n├──
