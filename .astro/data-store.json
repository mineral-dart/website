This project combines the power of Astro with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide a smooth development experience.\n\n## Why Explainer?\n\nDocumentation is often overlooked, but it's essential for the adoption and effective use of your project.\nExplainer fills an important gap in the technical documentation ecosystem. While Vue has robust solutions like Vitepress, the React ecosystem suffers from a lack of alternatives that don't depend on Next.js. Most documentation frameworks for React are closely tied to Next.js, which can be limiting for many projects.\n\nThis is where Astro, and by extension Explainer, particularly shines. Astro offers remarkable flexibility by allowing you to integrate any technological component related to your business. You can easily incorporate React, Vue, Svelte components, or even standard web elements according to your specific needs.\n\nThis agnostic approach allows you to create documentation that perfectly aligns with your existing technology stack, without forcing you to adopt a particular ecosystem. Whether you work with React, Vue, or other frameworks, Explainer adapts to your needs rather than the other way around.","src/content/blog/welcome.mdx","f5b3166b4e8226c4",true,"guide",["Map",25,26,35,36,44,45,53,54,63,64,72,73],"commands",{"id":25,"data":27,"body":32,"filePath":33,"digest":34,"deferredRender":22},{"title":28,"description":29,"permalink":25,"order":30,"icon":31},"Commands","Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",5,"lucide:square-slash","# Events","src/content/docs/guide/commands.mdx","cd48d09fc2241dd4","environment-variables",{"id":35,"data":37,"body":41,"filePath":42,"digest":43,"deferredRender":22},{"title":38,"description":29,"permalink":35,"order":39,"icon":40},"Environment variables",3,"lucide:key-round","# Environment variables\n\nEnvironment variables serve the purpose of storing secrets like the database password, the app secret, or an API key outside of your application codebase.\n\nIn addition, environment variables can be used to obtain different configurations depending on the environment, such as the use of a secret to use an API or database identifiers.\n\n> [!note]\n> Please read the full documentation of the environment in the dedicated [section](/docs/api/environment-variables).\n\n---\n\nWe're providing an `Environment` class to access the various environment variables in your application.\n\n:::code-group labels=[.env, schema.dart]\n```dotenv\nDART_ENV=development\nTOKEN=your_token\nDISCORD_REST_API_VERSION=10\nDISCORD_WS_VERSION=10\nINTENT=3276799\nLOG_LEVEL=TRACE\n```\n```dart\nfinal class AppEnv implements DefineEnvironment {\n  static final String dartEnv = 'DART_ENV';\n  static final String token = 'TOKEN';\n  static final String discordRestHttpVersion = 'DISCORD_REST_API_VERSION';\n  static final String discordWssVersion = 'DISCORD_WS_VERSION';\n  static final String intent = 'INTENT';\n  static final String logLevel = 'LOG_LEVEL';\n\n  @override\n  final Map\u003CString, EnvSchema> schema = {\n    dartEnv: env.enumerable(DartEnv.values),\n    token: env.string(),\n    discordRestHttpVersion: env.number(),\n    discordWssVersion: env.number(),\n    intent: env.number(),\n    logLevel: env.enumerable(LogLevel.values),\n  };\n}\n\nenum DartEnv implements Enumerable\u003CString> {\n  development('development'),\n  production('production');\n\n  @override\n  final String value;\n\n  const DartEnv(this.value);\n}\n```\n:::","src/content/docs/guide/environment-variables.mdx","d34329e4188f5426","deployment",{"id":44,"data":46,"body":50,"filePath":51,"digest":52,"deferredRender":22},{"title":47,"description":29,"permalink":44,"order":48,"icon":49},"Deployment",6,"lucide:rocket","# Deployment\n\nDeployment is an extremely important part of the process, but one that most developers dread because it falls outside the developer's core business and into that of devops.\n\n> [!important]\n> We recommend deploying via a docker system, see the [dedicated section](/docs/guide/deployment#docker).\n\n---\n\n## Build your application\n\nThe principal aim of Mineral is to simplify the developer experience. \nThat's why we've created a simple command to build your application and create an executable. \n\nThis executable is a single file that you can deploy anywhere, without having to worry about dependencies or other configuration. \n\nBesides, this allows you to share only the executable with your customers and not all the source code.\n\n> [!warning]\n> Dart creates an executable for your operating system.

In order to best install it, please refer to the [official documentation](https://dart.dev/get-dart).\n\n> [!note]\n> The version of the Dart language sdk must be at least `^3.5.2`.\n\n---\n\n## Setup new project\n\n### From the CLI\n\nYou can use the Mineral CLI to create a new project.\n\nFollow the steps below to install the CLI.\n\n:::code-group auto\n```bash\ndart pub global activate mineral_cli [version]\n\ncd path/to/your/projects\nmineral create my_project\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> More details about the CLI can be found in the [`command line`](/docs/api/cli) section.\n\n---\n\n### From scratch\n\nUse the following command to start a new blank Dart project.\n```bash\ndart create my_project\n```\n\nAfter creating the project, you will need to add the Mineral framework to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n:::code-group labels=[pubspec.yaml]\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  mineral: ^4.0.0-dev.11\n  mineral_cache: ^1.0.0-dev.4\n```\n:::\n\n> [!note]\n> Please verify the lasted version of the [`core`](https://pub.dev/packages/mineral) and [`cache`](https://pub.dev/packages/mineral_cache) packages directly on registry.\n\nThen run the following command to install the dependencies.\n\n:::code-group auto\n```bash\ndart pub get\n```\n:::\n\nMake sure you have the following minimal structure in your project.\nThe `.env` file is not created by default when you start a new Dart project, don't forget to create it.\n\n:::code-group labels=[boilerplate, .env]\n```\n├── bin\n│  └── main.dart\n│\n├── pubspec.yaml\n└── .env\n```\n```dotenv\nDART_ENV=development\nTOKEN=your_discord_token\nDISCORD_REST_API_VERSION=12\nDISCORD_WS_VERSION=12\nINTENT=3276799\nLOG_LEVEL=info\n```\n:::\n\n### Application\n\nThe `main.dart` file is the entry point of your application.
