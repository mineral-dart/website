# Alert

Alerts are UI components that help highlight important information to users. They can be used to provide feedback, warnings, errors, or general notes. 

In Explainer, alerts can be created using a simple Markdown syntax and can be either expanded by default or collapsible. Different types of alerts (`success`, `warning`, `note`, `error`) are available to convey different levels of importance or urgency.

## Success

```
> [!success]
> Some content is displayed directly!
```
> [!success]
> Some content is displayed directly!

## Warning

```
> [!warning] This is a **collapsible** callout
> Some content shown after opening!
```
> [!warning] This is a **collapsible** callout
> Some content shown after opening!

## Note

```
> [!note] This is a **collapsible** callout
> Some content shown after opening!
```
> [!note] This is a **collapsible** callout
> Some content shown after opening!

## Error
