# Code blocks

Code blocks are a way to display code in a readable format.
Explainer implements [`Shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) for syntax highlighting, you can read the [Shiki documentation](https://shiki.style) for more information on how to customize the syntax highlighting.

## Highlighting
Highlighting can be done before or after the declaration with the `[!code highlight]` syntax.

### Single line

Single highlight can be done with the `[!code highlight]` syntax.

```rust
pub struct User {
  // [!code highlight]
  pub firstname: String,
  pub lastname: String,
}
```

```rust
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String,
  pub lastname: String, // [!code highlight]
}
```

### Multiple lines

Multiple highlights can be done with the `[!code highlight:1,2]` syntax.

```rust {1,3-4}
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String,
  pub lastname: String,
}
```

---

## Code block with focused line

The `[!code focus:<n>]` syntax will highlight the line 2 of the code block.

```rust
pub struct User {
    // [!code focus:2]
  pub firstname: String,
  pub lastname: String,
}
```

---

## Code block with status

The `[!code error]` and `[!code warning]` syntax will highlight the line with the error or warning status.

### Code block with error

Error status can be done with the `[!code error]` syntax.

```rust
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String // [!code error]
  pub lastname: String,
}
```

### Code block with warning

Warning status can be done with the `[!code warning]` syntax.

```rust
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String, // [!code warning]
  pub lastname: String,
}
```

---

## Line modifiers

The `[!code --]` and `[!code ++]` syntax will remove or add a line to the code block.

```rust
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String,
  pub lastname: String,
}

impl User {
  pub fn new() -> Self { // [!code --]
  pub fn new(firstname: String, lastname: String) -> Self { // [!code ++]
    Self { firstname, lastname }
  }
}
```

---

## Group code blocks

Group code blocks can be done with the `:::code-group labels=[...labels]` syntax.

> [!warning] This is a **collapsible** callout
> Only code blocks can be used in a group.

:::code-group labels=[Without labels, With labels]
```
:::code-group auto
// Code block without labels
:::
```

```
:::code-group labels=[first,, third]
// First code block (named)
// Second code block
// Third code block (named)
:::
```
:::

:::code-group labels=[struct, impl]
```rust
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String, // [!code highlight]
  pub lastname: String,
}
```

```rust
pub struct User {
  pub firstname: String,
  pub lastname: String,
}

impl User {
  pub fn new(firstname: String, lastname: String) -> Self {
    Self { firstname, lastname }
  }
}
```
