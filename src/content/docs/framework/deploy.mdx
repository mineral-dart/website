# Deployment

Explainer uses [`Playwrite`](https://playwright.dev/) to generate diagrams written with [`Mermaid`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/).

Your environment must support installing Playwrite and its browsers in order for Explainer to generate all your pages.

## Cloudflare Pages

Explainer provides a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your static site to a Cloudflare Pages environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Cloudflare does not allow the installation of Playwright or its browsers.
> You must use an external CI/CD pipeline to generate the diagrams and then push them to your Cloudflare Pages environment.
