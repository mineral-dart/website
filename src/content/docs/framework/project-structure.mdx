Let's break down the key directories and files in the Explainer project:

## Public folder
This directory contains static assets that will be served directly without processing. 
Files like favicons, robots.txt, and other assets that don't need transformation should be placed here.

--- 
## Content folder
The main source directory containing all the application code.

The `content` folder is divided into two parts:
- `docs` : Contains the documentation pages
- `blog` : Contains the blog articles

### Docs Structure
The `docs` directory contains all your documentation content organized by collections.

### Blog Structure
The `blog` directory contains all your blog articles.
