# Commands

Slash commands were implemented with the aim of replacing messages considered as commands with a start-of-line
character, often defined as a message prefix like `!`.

## Introduction

The Discord API allows users to interact with bots in a more intuitive and structured way, using predefined syntax to make it easier to execute specific commands without having to remember prefixes or complex message formats.

They were created to replace message-based commands with prefixes, making the user experience smoother and reducing
syntax errors.

> [!note]
> When you change the structure of your commands, please restart your entire application process so that the changes take
> effect even if the `hmr` is active.

## Builder approach

Let's take a simple example of a bot that listens to the `MessageCreate` event and prints the message content to the console.

From the `Client`, we can chain event listeners using the following pattern :

:::code-group labels=[main.dart]
```dart
Future<void> main(_, port) async {
  final client = ClientBuilder()
    .setHmrDevPort(port)
    .build();

  client.commands.declare((command) {
    command
      ..setName('foo')
      ..setDescription('This is a command description')
      ..setHandler((ctx) => ctx.interaction.reply('Hello, world!'));
  });

  await client.init();
}
```

## Object-oriented approach

For benchmarking purposes, we recommend using the `functional` approach, but when developing applications requiring 
more than 2 events or commands, we recommend using the object-oriented approach.

:::code-group labels=[command.dart, main.dart]
```dart
final class MyCommand implements CommandDeclaration {
  void handle(CommandContext ctx) {
    print('Hello, world!');
  }
  
  @override
  CommandDeclarationBuilder build() {
    return CommandDeclarationBuilder()
      ..setName('foo')
      ..setDescription('This is a command description')
      ..setHandler(handle);
  }
}
```
```dart
Future<void> main(_, port) async {
  final client = ClientBuilder()
    .setHmrDevPort(port)
    .build();

  client.register(MyCommand.new);

  await client.init();
}
```
