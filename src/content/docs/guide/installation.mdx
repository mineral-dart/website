# Installation

Before embarking on this crazy discord adventure, you will need to follow the steps outlined below to set up a clean and healthy project.

---

## Prerequisites
Please make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine before you start.

### Dart lang
The Mineral framework has been developed entirely in the Dart programming language, so you will need to install it in your development environment first. In order to best install it, please refer to the [official documentation](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

> [!note]
> The version of the Dart language sdk must be at least `^3.5.2`.

---

## Setup new project

### From the CLI

You can use the Mineral CLI to create a new project.

Follow the steps below to install the CLI.

:::code-group auto
```bash
dart pub global activate mineral_cli [version]

cd path/to/your/projects
mineral create my_project
```
:::

> [!note]
> More details about the CLI can be found in the [`command line`](/docs/api/cli) section.

---

### From scratch

Use the following command to start a new blank Dart project.
```bash
dart create my_project
```

After creating the project, you will need to add the Mineral framework to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

:::code-group labels=[pubspec.yaml]
```yaml
dependencies:
  mineral: ^4.0.0-dev.11
  mineral_cache: ^1.0.0-dev.4
```
:::

> [!note]
> Please verify the lasted version of the [`core`](https://pub.dev/packages/mineral) and [`cache`](https://pub.dev/packages/mineral_cache) packages directly on registry.

Then run the following command to install the dependencies.

:::code-group auto
```bash
dart pub get
```
:::

Make sure you have the following minimal structure in your project.
The `.env` file is not created by default when you start a new Dart project, don't forget to create it.

:::code-group labels=[boilerplate, .env]
```
â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ main.dart
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
â””â”€â”€ .env
```
```dotenv
DART_ENV=development
TOKEN=your_discord_token
DISCORD_REST_API_VERSION=12
DISCORD_WS_VERSION=12
INTENT=3276799
LOG_LEVEL=info
```
:::

### Application

The `main.dart` file is the entry point of your application. This is where you will start your bot.

:::code-group labels=[main.dart]
```dart
void main(_, port) async {
  final client = ClientBuilder()
    .setHmrDevPort(port)
    .build();

  await client.init();
}
```
:::

To check that your application is working properly, we recommend that you use the `ready` event.

:::code-group labels=[main.dart]
```dart
void main(_, port) async {
  final client = ClientBuilder()
    .setHmrDevPort(port)
    .build();
  
  // [!code ++:3]
  client.events.ready((Bot bot) {
    client.logger.info('${bot.username} is ready ! ðŸš€');
  });

  await client.init();
}
```
:::

## Running the application

Finally, you can run your application with the following command.

:::code-group auto
```bash
dart run src/main.dart
```
