# Environment variables

Environment variables serve the purpose of storing secrets like the database password, the app secret, or an API key outside of your application codebase.

In addition, environment variables can be used to obtain different configurations depending on the environment, such as the use of a secret to use an API or database identifiers.

> [!note]
> Please read the full documentation of the environment in the dedicated [section](/docs/api/environment-variables).

We're providing an `Environment` class to access the various environment variables in your application.

:::code-group labels=[.env, schema.dart]
```dotenv
DART_ENV=development
TOKEN=your_token
DISCORD_REST_API_VERSION=10
DISCORD_WS_VERSION=10
INTENT=3276799
LOG_LEVEL=TRACE
```
```dart
final class AppEnv implements DefineEnvironment {
  static final String dartEnv = 'DART_ENV';
  static final String token = 'TOKEN';
  static final String discordRestHttpVersion = 'DISCORD_REST_API_VERSION';
  static final String discordWssVersion = 'DISCORD_WS_VERSION';
  static final String intent = 'INTENT';
  static final String logLevel = 'LOG_LEVEL';

  @override
  final Map<String, EnvSchema> schema = {
    dartEnv: env.enumerable(DartEnv.values),
    token: env.string(),
    discordRestHttpVersion: env.number(),
    discordWssVersion: env.number(),
    intent: env.number(),
    logLevel: env.enumerable(LogLevel.values),
  };
}

enum DartEnv implements Enumerable<String> {
  development('development'),
  production('production');

  @override
  final String value;

  const DartEnv(this.value);
}
```

### token
The `TOKEN` variable is a secret key that is used to authenticate the application with the Discord API. 

`TOKEN` is used for Discord Websocket and API authentications, [read more](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway-events#identify).

> [!warning]
> `TOKEN` is private and should not be shared with anyone.

---

### http_version
The `DISCORD_REST_API_VERSION` variable is the version of the HTTP protocol that the application will use to communicate with the Discord API.

`DISCORD_REST_API_VERSION` defines the version of the HTTP protocol that the application will use to communicate with the Discord API, [read more](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#api-versioning).

---

### wss_version
The `DISCORD_WS_VERSION` variable is the version of the Websocket protocol that the application will use to communicate with the Discord API.

`DISCORD_WS_VERSION` defines the version of the Websocket protocol that the application will use to communicate with the Discord API, [read more](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateways-gateway-versions).

---

### intent
The `INTENT` variable is the intent that the application will use to receive events from the Discord API.

`INTENT` defines the intent that the application will use to receive events from the Discord API, [read more](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).

---

### log_level
The `LOG_LEVEL` variable is the level of logging that the application will use to log messages.

```dart
const logLevels = {
  'TRACE': logging.Level.FINEST,
  'FATAL': logging.Level.SHOUT,
  'ERROR': logging.Level.SEVERE,
  'WARN': logging.Level.WARNING,
  'INFO': logging.Level.INFO,
};
```

> [!note]
> The `trace` level is the lowest level, used in particular for debugging or log reporting by a third party such as [`loki`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/).

---

### dart_env
The `DART_ENV` variable is a string that determines whether the application will use partial reload.
