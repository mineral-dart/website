# Contribute

Contributions are the basis of any open-source project. They enable the project to evolve, fix bugs, add features and much more.
We're delighted that you want to contribute to our project !

> [!important]
> Your help is invaluable in improving and growing this project.

## How to contribute

Contributions can take several forms. Here are a few examples:

- Improving the documentation with your feedback and experiments
- Report and/or fixing bugs in [issues](https://github.com/mineral-dart/core/issues)
- Adding missing functionalities through forks and pull requests
- Suggest improvements to the user experience
- Help the community by answering questions from other users

---

## Improving the documentation

The documentation is the first point of contact for users. It must be clear, concise and easy to understand.

This aspect of the project is crucial to its adoption and use by the community, but it takes up an infinite amount of
time to write, to the detriment of the actual development of new features.

---

### API documentation

The API documentation is generated using the `dartdoc` tool. It is automatically generated and updated with each new
release.

Each method must be documented, as well as each parameter, return type and exception.
It's this aspect in particular that consumes an infinite amount of our time.

Si vous souhaitez-nus aider à améliorer la documentation, vous pouvez suivre les étapes suivantes :

1. Fork the project
2. Make your `dartdoc` comments
3. Push your changes and create a pull request

You can also use the following template to document the methods :

````dart
/// Title of the method
///
/// Description of the method
///
/// Example :
/// ```dart
/// // Code example
/// ```
///
void fn() {}
````

### Website documentation

The framework documentation is the second most important part of the documentation.
understand how to use the framework.

Unlike API documentation, here we'll explain the concepts, functionalities and best practices, while providing
theoretical and concrete examples to help users understand how the framework works while providing theoretical and
practical examples to help users understand how the framework works.

If you wish to clarify certain points, add examples or even correct errors, you can follow the steps below:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/mineral-dart/website)
2. Make your changes
3. Push your changes and create a pull request
4. Wait for the review
5. Once the review is complete, your changes will be merged

### Reporting bugs

Bugs are a common occurrence in software development. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect
implementation, incorrect use of the framework, or even a lack of understanding of the framework.

The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to reproduce the bug and correct it, so we recommend that
you provide the following information.

- Give context (show `pubspec.yaml`)
- Description of the bug (copy/paste the error message)
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots or code snippets (optional)

If you encounter a bug, you can report it by following these steps:

1. Go to the [issues](https://github.com/mineral-dart/core/issues/new)
2. Fill in the form with the necessary information
3. Click on the "Submit new issue" button
4. Wait for the review by the core team

### Adding missing features

The framework is constantly evolving. New features are added regularly to improve the user experience and make the
framework more complete.

> [!note]
> You can find the roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/mineral-dart/projects/5/views/2).

#### Installation

When we develop the core functionalities, it is preferable to create a blank application simulating a real application
with the `core` package at the same folder level.

We therefore consider the following structure :

```
├── root
│  └── bot
│  └── core
│  │
│  └── other packages
```

In your bot application `pubspec.yaml` file, add the following dependency.

> [!note]
> In accordance with the [documentation](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies), using a `path` allows you to develop functionality locally.

:::code-group labels=[pubspec.yaml, bash]

```yaml
dependencies:
  mineral:
    path: ../core

  # Optional
  mineral_cache:
    path: ../cache
```

```bash
dart pub get
```
