# Governance

Mineral is an open-source project that thrives on community collaboration and shared vision. Its governance model ensures transparency, inclusivity, and alignment with the project's goals.

---

## Roles and responsibilities

### Authors

Parmantier Baptiste (the creator of Mineral) is the author of the project.

The project author is responsible for the governance, standards and direction of the project.
In a nutshell:

- The Project Author decides which new projects should exist under the Mineral banner.
- The Project Owner is responsible for assigning project members to the various tasks and for transferring tasks to a
  project member when an existing member retires.
- It is the author's responsibility to share/document the framework's vision and keep members aligned with it.

### Core team

Members of the core team are contributors who have made multiple valuable contributions to the project and are now
relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others.

In many cases, they are programmers, but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role, for example,
community engagement.
Typically, a core team member will focus on a specific aspect of the project and will bring a level of expertise and
understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead.

The role of core team member is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community
will find themselves in as the project
lead looks to them for guidance and support.

The members of the core team have no authority over the general direction of the project. However, they do have the ear
of the project leader. It is the responsibility of core team members to ensure that each member is aware of the needs of
the community and the collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project.

Often, core team members are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility and are given the right
to directly modify certain parts of the source code. In other words, although core team members do not have explicit
decision-making power, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with decisions made by the project owner.

### Users

Users are members of the community who need the project. They are the most important members of the community: without
them, the project would have no reason to exist. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions
enable the project team to ensure that it is meeting the needs of those users.

Users who continue to get involved in the project and its community will become more and more involved. These users can
then become contributors, as described above.

## Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management
infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognize that
all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows.

## Branding and Ownership

Only the projects under the `mineral_` dart pub scope and the Mineral GitHub organization are managed and officially
supported by the core team.

Also, you must not use the Mineral name or logos in a way that could mistakenly imply any official connection with or
endorsement of Mineral. Any use of the Mineral name or logos in a manner that could cause customer confusion is not
permitted.

Instead, you must use your own brand name in a way that clearly distinguishes it from Mineral.

Additionally, you may not use our trademarks for t-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise without explicit written
consent.
