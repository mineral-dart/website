# Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation for the Mineral framework.

Mineral is a backend framework developed in Dart as an abstraction of the official Discord API while integrating an ecosystem to facilitate the development of your Discord applications.

Although the Dart language is like a mix between Java and Typescript, we recommend that you experiment with the language itself before you start developing with the Mineral framework.

## Philosophy

We want to focus our efforts on the following areas:

- Developer Experience
- Performance, security and low power consumption thanks to the Dart language
- Robustness, modularity and flexibility
- Complete and intuitive documentation
- Rich ecosystem

### Our motivations

In the various programming languages, there are a multitude of alternatives offering an API for interaction with Discord.
with Discord, the best known being [discord.js](http://discord.js.org), [eris.js](https://abal.moe/Eris/) or even
[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [jda](https://jda.wiki/introduction/jda/).

Within the Dart language, there is only one alternative called [Nyxx](https://nyxx.l7ssha.xyz) which, like
discord.js, provides a complete API for developing great Discord bots in a relatively
functional form.

### Librairie vs Framework

#### `Library`

A set of functions or classes that can be used to carry out specific operations. It provides
a set of predefined functions that you can use in your code, so you don't have to write them yourself.
writing the functionality yourself.

#### `Framework`

A set of structured software components and libraries that provide a basis on which you can develop your own application.
develop your own application. It defines the structure of your application and provides predefined
predefined functionality that you can use. Unlike a library, a framework can dictate your application's flow of
control flow of your application, i.e. it can define the overall architecture of your project.

If it were simply a question of providing what the wonderful Nyxx library has to offer, the mineral project would have been pointless.

In fact, we want to professionalise the development of Discord bots within the Dart language by providing a
ecosystem for developers.

Drawing on our experience, we want to offer a robust alternative to the traditional event handler that we
found on almost every Discord bot project.

### One problem, one solution

When designing a Discord bot, it is common to encounter various problems related to the architecture of your
project. It is often difficult to structure your code in such a way that it is readable, maintainable and scalable.
