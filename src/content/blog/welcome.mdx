# Welcome to Explainer

Explainer is a documentation boilerplate designed to help you create beautiful, responsive, and accessible web documentation using [Astro](https://astro.build). This project combines the power of Astro with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide a smooth development experience.

## Why Explainer?

Documentation is often overlooked, but it's essential for the adoption and effective use of your project.
Explainer fills an important gap in the technical documentation ecosystem. While Vue has robust solutions like Vitepress, the React ecosystem suffers from a lack of alternatives that don't depend on Next.js. Most documentation frameworks for React are closely tied to Next.js, which can be limiting for many projects.

This is where Astro, and by extension Explainer, particularly shines. Astro offers remarkable flexibility by allowing you to integrate any technological component related to your business. You can easily incorporate React, Vue, Svelte components, or even standard web elements according to your specific needs.

This agnostic approach allows you to create documentation that perfectly aligns with your existing technology stack, without forcing you to adopt a particular ecosystem. Whether you work with React, Vue, or other frameworks, Explainer adapts to your needs rather than the other way around.
